# UZH-Deep-Learning-in-Marketing
UZH Deep Learning in Marketing 2020 Spring Course Project

Team: Noah Chavannes, Yves Rutishauser, Xiao'ao Song,  Molin Chen

The background knowledge for GAN is provided in tutorial folder. This is the first step for us to learn GAN.

The cycleGAN tutorial folder contains the related knowledge for CycleGAN network.

The mycyclegan folder contains the code that implements the paper "Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks" (by Xiao'ao). Our pre-trained model weights is also included.

The ganilla folder contains the network that implements the paper "GANILLA: Generative Adversarial Networks for Image to Illustration Translation" (by Noah and Yves), However, the weights are not provided due to insufficient time to train a good model. 

The discoGAN folder contains the introduction and implementation of the paper "Learning to Discover Cross-Domain Relations with Generative Adversarial Networks"(from github open source).  However, it is only used for study not for production since the model has not been adapted to dress and shoes domain due to insufficient time.
