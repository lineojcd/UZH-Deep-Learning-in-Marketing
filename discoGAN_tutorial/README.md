# discoGAN

## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/MgdAe-T8obE) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval as part of the Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree. We're going to use a relatively new variant of the generative adversarial network called the [discogan](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05192). This will allow us to perfrom style transfer, that is generate an image in the style of another. Very cool stuff. 

## Dependencies

* tensorflow
* matplotlib
* numpy
* tqdm

install dependencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

## Usage

run `jupyter notebook` in terminal to see the code pop up in your browser

install juypter [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) if you don't have it. 

## Credits

The credits for this code go to [chunyuan](https://github.com/ChunyuanLI/DiscoGAN) i've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
